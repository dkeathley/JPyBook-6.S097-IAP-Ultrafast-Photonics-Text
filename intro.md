## Course Description

Knowledge of the fundamentals of ultrafast photonics is becoming increasingly valuable as ultrafast optical sources become more ubiquitous with an ever-growing number of applications. Relatively compact ultrafast optical sources with pulse durations ranging from nanoseconds down to femtoseconds are now commercially available across a broad range of wavelengths. Current applications are wide-ranging and include biological imaging, quantum optical technologies, chemical sensing, and precision measurements of time and distance among many others. During this IAP course, we will cover the essentials of ultrafast photonics. Topics will include: (1) the science of ultrafast laser pulses and their interaction with matter; (2) the technology to generate and manipulate ultrafast pulses of light; and (3) an overview of select applications of ultrafast photonics systems. This course will serve as a foundation for those interested in experimental and/or theoretical work involving ultrafast optical systems. Some basic knowledge of Fourier analysis, differential equations, and electromagnetic waves is assumed. 

This course is designed to overlap and coordinate with an ultrafast photonics course taught by Prof. William Putnam at U.C. Davis. Dr. Keathley will lead the lectures and course at MIT, with online material, such as lecture recordings and notes, being shared between MIT and UC Davis.

## Course Structure and Topics Covered

The course is structured into five chapters the content of which will be presented over eight lectures. The chapters and lectures will be organized as follows.

 - **Chapter 1 (Lecture 1):**  Introduction
     - Introduction to the course
     - Notation
     - Quantifying ultrafast pulses
     - Time-frequency relations
     - Core principles of ultrafast pulse formation
 - **Chapter 2 (Lectures 2 and 3):** Pulse Interaction with Linear Media
    - Reflection and transmission elements
    - Cavities
    - Propagation in dispersive media (pulse stretching and compression)
 - **Chapter 3 (Lectures 4 and 5):** Nonlinear Pulse Propagation
    - Self-phase modulation
    - Soliton formation
    - Supercontinuum generation
    - Modeling a nonlinear photonic switch
 - **Chapter 4 (Lecture 6):** Modelocking (Active and Passive)
 - **Chapter 5 (Lectures 7 and 8):** Dispersion Management and Pulse Characterization 
    - Pulse compression schemes
    - Autocorrelation 
    - Phase characterization
    - EO sampling

## Reading Materials and Reference

This course will largely pull from the [Ultrafast Optics text from Franz Kaertner](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-977-ultrafast-optics-spring-2005/f806ff596f9bffb74003360e2c05c086_MIT6_977S05_textbook.pdf).  In table {numref}`tbl-reading-material`, particular reading material of interest is highlighted for each chapter.

Another excellent book you can use to compliment this material is [Andrew Weiner's Ultrafast Optics textbook](https://mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?context=L&docid=alma990016692990106761&lang=en&search_scope=all&tab=all&vid=01MIT_INST:MIT). (The link is to the MIT library page which provides access to a digital version).

Finally, you will have access through the UC Davis Canvas website for their winter quarter course on Ultrafast Photonics.  We will move at an accelerated pace, but you are encouraged to look ahead at leacture material and past lectures to provide further context and extended information about particular topics presented in this IAP course.  

## Problem Sets

There will be three problem sets.  

The problem sets will be uploaded here as the course progresses.  Submission and grading will be through the course [Canvas Page](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/20238).  

## Course Materials

Course materials can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PLPXFHaRfZv0kEO8l_J4AB7U0dIZcLFk?usp=share_link).  There you will find archived content from last years course (also joint with UC Davis), as well as content for this ongoing course (lecture notes, videos, etc).  

You can also find materials on the [UC Davis Canvas course page](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/). **If you did not receive access to any of this material, please let me know via Slack or email.** 

## Course Credit

This course will be for credit as P/D/F.  A passing grade will be determined from course participation and problem sets.  A passing student should show sufficient engagement with the material.
