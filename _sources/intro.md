# Basics of Ultrafast Optics with Computational Examples

This is the course website for 2023 IAP course 6.S097 -- Ultrafast Photonics.  

## Course Description

Knowledge of the fundamentals of ultrafast photonics is becoming increasingly valuable as ultrafast optical sources become more ubiquitous with an ever-growing number of applications. Relatively compact ultrafast optical sources with pulse durations ranging from nanoseconds down to femtoseconds are now commercially available across a broad range of wavelengths. Current applications are wide-ranging and include biological imaging, quantum optical technologies, chemical sensing, and precision measurements of time and distance among many others. During this IAP course, we will cover the essentials of ultrafast photonics. Topics will include: (1) the science of ultrafast laser pulses and their interaction with matter; (2) the technology to generate and manipulate ultrafast pulses of light; and (3) an overview of select applications of ultrafast photonics systems. This course will serve as a foundation for those interested in experimental and/or theoretical work involving ultrafast optical systems. Some basic knowledge of Fourier analysis, differential equations, and electromagnetic waves is assumed. 

This course is designed to overlap and coordinate with an ultrafast photonics course taught by Prof. William Putnam at U.C. Davis. Dr. Keathley will lead the lectures and course at MIT, with online material, such as lecture recordings and notes, being shared between MIT and UC Davis.
