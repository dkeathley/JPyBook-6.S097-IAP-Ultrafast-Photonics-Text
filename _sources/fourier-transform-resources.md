# Resources for those new to Fourier Transforms

We realize that some of you may have had limited exposure to Fourier Transforms.  We use the Fourier Transform as a tool to move back and forth between timme and frequency representations of optical waveforms as some problems are much easier to solve in the frequency domain.  

Unfortunately we do not have the time to cover Fourier Transforms in detail.  The lectures try to touch on what is needed to be understood to understand the physics discussed.  To dive deeper, we have collected some resources and notes that might be helpful for those that have more limited experience and want to dive a bit deeper. 

## Connection to Fourier Series

If you have been introduced to Fourier Series then there is an easy way to conceptualize the Fourier Transform.  Fourier Series are used to represent periodic functions as a series of sinusoidal waves having frequencies that are integer multiples of the period.  A Fourier Transform is in essence an extension of the Fourier Series in the limit where the period goes to infinity leading to a continuous distribution of frequency components.  Try to see this connection yourself by taking the expression for the Fourier Series and comparing it to the expression for the Fourier Transform letting the period $T$ go to $\infty$.  

## Table of Fourier Transform Pairs

Here is a link to a [useful table of Fourier Transform pairs](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/baug/ibk/structural-mechanics-dam/education/identmeth/fourier.pdf) that uses the same convention we use in this class.  We use many of these properties to gain intuition about the time and frequency domain representations.  Have a copy of this handy when working problems as it can be very helpful.

## Other Online Resources

There are of course many online resources you can find through a simple search.  We have collated a few here:
